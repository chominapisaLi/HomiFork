Thank you for your interest in helping out. I'd like to mention a few things to check when you open a pull request:

- When you create a fork, make your changes in a separate branch. (Don't use `master`)
- If you know about bugs in your code, please mention them in the pull request.
- Your code can be a work-in-progress if you want others to help or need opinions, just make sure to mention that in the pull request.
- Follow the [CFC style guidelines](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/cfc_glua_style_guidelines). Optionally you can also install [glualint](https://github.com/FPtje/GLuaFixer) and it's extension to get warnings right on your preferred text editor.
