This is a gmod server optimization. It will provide improved frames when the server is full of players, Not only this but it will also reduce the lag when there are lots of props on the server. For serverside optimization the servers networking is highly reduced while using seats and prisoner pods. Widgets get disabled to reduce the cpu usage of the server.
